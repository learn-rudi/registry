Hi [Name],

This is an example email file. Replace the content with your actual message.

You can use this as a template:
1. Update the "to:" field in the frontmatter with a contact name or email
2. Update the "subject:" field
3. Write your message below the "---" line
4. Save the file

Then send with:
```
python workflows/send_from_file.py drafts/your_filename.md
```

Best,
Brandon
