<p>Hi Rachael,</p>

<p>Happy Friday! It's been too long since we last connected - I pray that everything has been going well for you.</p>

<p>I was at AfroTech presenting this year and learned a ton. Got me thinking about you and what Crowe might be planning for 2026, especially around AI. Would love to catch up, exchange notes, and hear what you're seeing on your end.</p>

<p>On my side, I've been heads down building out RUDI (Responsible Use and Digital Intelligence) - happy to share what we've learned if it's helpful, but really just want to reconnect and hear what you've been up to.</p>

<p>Any chance you're free over the next couple of weeks?</p>

<p>All the best,<br>
Brandon</p>
